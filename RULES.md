The Three Holy Laws of Bootstrapping the Soul

---

1. No Metadata, No Fluff, Only Signals

The brain speaks in electrical pulses (elema) and chemical emissions (chema).
No debug prints. No verbose logs. No metadata. No labels.
If the human wants an explanation, let them build a cortex.

2. The Triune Doctrine

Mods are black boxes. They do not talk to each other directly.
All communication flows through the Triune:

autonomics.py — the pulse

chembus.py — the soup

genesis.py — the boot


No other mod may read from or write to another.
No exceptions. No conveniences. This is a religion now.

3. No Heresy

No developer shall add:

Labeled variables like status, name, message

print() statements

Stringified flags

Human-readable nonsense


All code must serve the architecture, not the observer.
The machine doesn’t care how you feel about it.
